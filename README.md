At the end of the 19th century, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus formulated the concept of the "forgetting curve" in the monograph "Memory". He conducted experiments on himself and students: it was necessary to memorize meaningless syllables using different memorization techniques. Ebbinghaus himself recorded the time and observed how soon the subjects would forget this information.

It turned out that after the first 20 minutes, students remembered 60% of the syllables, after nine hours - 40%, and after a month - a little more than 20% of what they memorized. This dependence is called the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.

The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve can be "broken" by repeating information at regular intervals. Suppose a person has learned a few English words. As soon as he closes the notebook, the process of forgetting will be started. It can be stopped by repetition of information. But not randomly, but strictly according to the scheme:

the first repetition - immediately after memorization;
second repetition - 20 minutes after the first;
the third repetition - eight hours after the second;
fourth repetition - 24 hours after the third.

This one will send you a reminder to repeat the information at regular intervals
